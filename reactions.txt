# Reactions.txt
# Contains elemental reactions for the game, maybe parsable?


# Parse this via the game? omgsuperhard
# Anyways, here's some syntax:

# [ELEMENT CATEGORY: (Oxide, metal, acid, base)] - variable element

# [Element category, mendeleyev table period(IA-VIIIA, IB-VIIIB)] - variable element limited to Mendeleyev period
# WATER - constant element

# -> - reaction delimiter, on the left are beginning elements, on the right are ending elements
# + - reaction addition, these two elements react (when on the left side) or are created (when on the right side)

#

[ACID] + [BASE] -> [SALT] + WATER
[ACID] + [METAL, IA-IIA] -> [SALT] + HYDROGEN
[METAL] + [OXYGEN] -> [OXIDE]
